          <h2>Account</h2>
          <p>Cryptasia's basic services are free. But some people want more than 
          basic - they want <i>advanced</i>.</p>
          <p>If you're one of these go-getters, sign up for a paid account. It only costs $10 a year, and you won't be billed until after the first month.  If you don't want to use it after that time, you don't have to pay anything!</p>
          <p>With a paid account, you'll still use cryptasia.com to get passwords. 
          However, you can also: </p>
          <ul>
             <li>Instantly add new websites, like your local bank, online message board or favorite pizza place</li>
             <li>Change a website's password without memorizing a new secret phrase</li>
             <li>Use one secret phrase to generate multiple passwords per website (useful if you
             have multiple accounts at a website)</li>
             <li>Control as much as you want - you don't even have to share your settings with us!</li>
             <li>Be the first to get free software like a mobile app or additional features that could include
             automatically filling in usernames on websites.</li>
          </ul>
