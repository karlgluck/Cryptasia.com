          <h2>How it Works</h2>
          <p>Everyone knows that it's best to use a different long, complex password for
          every website.  But who can come up with and remember a single password like
          <span style="font-family:courier;">G'Er^6>_B[np3;q`BF:+T|$/e";l:mog</span>, much less dozens?</p>
          <p>That's where Cryptasia comes in.  When you want to log in to a website, here's what to do:</p>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Name the website. </strong>A list of sites Cryptasia knows will appear
          as you're typing. Hit enter when the correct one is selected, or click one from the list,
          to choose it and move to the next field.</li>
          <li><strong>Think of a secret phrase.</strong> It can be as long or as complex as you like, and you only need one.</li>
          <li><strong>Enter your phrase in the second field.</strong> An image will pop up once you've finished
          typing. The image is based on the phrase entered, so you should get the same image every time. If you
          get a different image, re-enter your secret phrase.</li>
          <li><strong>Get your password.</strong> Click the "Copy+Go" link to go directly to the website of
          your choice. Enter in your user information, paste your password, and you're in!</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Because passwords generated by Cryptasia are based on the website you select, they
          will always meet password requirements for that website. Also, every website's password 
          will be unique, even if you use the same phrase for multiple websites.</p>
          <h2>How can I trust you?</h2>
          <p>The great thing about Cryptasia is that <i>you don't have to!</i> Even with
          <a href="account.html">your own account</a>, our service works without storing
          your secret phrase, passwords or even knowing who you are.  None of your secrets
          ever leave your browser.  In fact, the code that runs Cryptasia is public and
          available for everyone to see.</p>
          <h2>Tips</h2>
          <p>When typing the website name, Cryptasia will suggest matches.  Hit Enter
          or Tab to pick the highlighted one and jump to the next field.</p>
          <p>Cryptasia generates passwords for a <i>lot</i> of websites. However, some
          aren't a part of the site...yet. If you want to use Cryptasia to get a password
          for something not in the system, you can <a href="account.html">sign up for a paid account</a>
          and add all the new websites you want.</p>
          <p>Cryptasia has a great mobile site, too!  However, the "Copy+Go" button had to be
          replaced because it uses <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">Flash</a>,
          which doesn't work on most phones.  Still, we've worked hard to make it as easy
          as possible.  All you have to do is long-tap the Password box, select the
          password text and hit "Copy".</p>
